          This plugin displays and hides a splash screen during application launch.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
          Your application cannot call navigator.splashscreen.show() until the app has started and the
          deviceready event has fired. But since typically the splash screen
          is meant to be visible before your app has started, that would seem to defeat the purpose of the splash screen.
